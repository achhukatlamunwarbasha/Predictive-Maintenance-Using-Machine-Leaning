# Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting machine failures using predictive analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze machine operational data and identify failure patterns to support proactive maintenance decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains 10,000 records related to machine operating conditions such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
- Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Cross-Validation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be applied to industrial data to reduce machine downtime and improve maintenance efficiency.
